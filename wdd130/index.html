       What is there to know about little ol' me? Well for starters, I initially wanted to be a radiologist.
       I went to UND as a Pre-Med student in hopes of taking the MCAT and going off to medical school.
       But alas, that was not the plan intended for me. I failed Chemistry 3 seperate times. So instead,
       I decided to give education a try. I transferred down to NDSU and half way through the semester
       Covid struck. I contracted a nasty case of pneumonia and was bedridden for two months.

        I don't do well with online learning and decided to work for the time being until universities
        opened back up and I could take classes in person. After effectively hiding from school for the next
        three years working various jobs, I knew I needed to move forward with my life and applied for BYU-I.
        After I was accepted, a friend of mine gave me a piece of advise I took to heart. He said, "Find a job
        that will support the lifestyle you're looking for."I looked at my options, conducted my own research, 
        and came to the conclusion that earning a degree in Computer Science would afford me the opportunities 
        neccesary for achieving the lifestyle I want.

        Other things of note, I am currently not married. I have been a member of the church my entire life.
        My favorite scripture currently is 1Nephi 20:10 which talks about the refining process the Lord puts
        us through in order to become the saints and disciples He needs us to be.

        My hobbies include (but are not limited to:) music, games (board, card, video, ttrpg, etc.), reading,
        writing, and cooking. Those are the ones that first come to mind. If you have any questions about me,
        feel free to ask! I'm an open book about pretty much anything.
