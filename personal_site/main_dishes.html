            <h2>Curry Rice</h2>
            <p>For this recipe you'll need: 1 cup of medium grain white rice (per person)
                1 lb of your preferred meat cut into 1 in cubes (beef, pork, chicken)
                1 large white or yellow onion sliced
                2 packets of Golden Curry Japanese Curry Mix
                4 1/2 cups water
            </p><br>
            <p>Make sure to wash your rice before cooking it. Cover completely in water 
                and agitate with your fingers before straining. Repeat until water is mostly clear.
                While your rice is cooking, in a large skillet panfry the meat and onions together making 
                sure to create a fond at the bottom of your pan. Add your preferred seasonings (usually salt, 
                pepper, and garlic powder). Add in the water and bring to a boil. Make sure to scrape the 
                bottom of the pan to get that flavor mixed in with the rest. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer 
                for 20 minutes. Add in the curry packets and remove from heat. Mix until homogenous.
            </p><br>
            <p>Optionally, you can fry a breaded chicken cutlet and add to the top.</p>

                <h2>Mason's Stroganoff Spinoff</h2>
                <p>1 lb ground beef 
                    2 cups chicken broth 
                    12 oz sour cream 
                    1 cup cheese (any variety of melting cheese will do) 
                    1 medium lemon zested
                    1 box of your favorite pasta (I use rotini)
                </p><br>
                <p>In a large pot bring water up to a boil and add your pasta. Drain when al dente saving 1/4 cup 
                    of the pasta water.
                    Brown the hamburger in a large skillet with onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and 
                    italian herbs. Drain the grease and add in the chicken broth. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a 
                    simmer. Take about 1/2 cup of the hot broth and (in a seperate bowl) mix it with the pasta water and 
                    sour cream. Add the mixture back into the pan. Slowly incoportate the 1 cup of cheese. Once that's all 
                    mixed together, remove from heat and add in the lemon zest and pasta and mix. Season to taste.
