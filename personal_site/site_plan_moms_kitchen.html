      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        the main home page will contain information on what we at Mom's Kitchen
         hope to provide to those who visit our website with. Namely, an overview 
         of the types of recipes we cover, the history of Mom's Kitchen, and possibly 
         contact information for recipe clarification, but that is still to be determined.

      </ul>
      <h3>Main Dishes</h3>
      <p>
        For a second page, I thought it would be nice to have that one cover 'Main Dishes'. 
        Your casseroles, entrees, showstopper types of dishes. These would include the 
        biscuits and gravy recipe, Aunt Pauline's casserole, Tatertot casserole, and Mason's 
        Stroganoff. Of course, alongside the recipes, we'll need pictures and step by step 
        instructions on how to make them, but they're all relatively simple.

      <h3>Desserts</h3>
      <p>
        For a third and final page, I was thinking we could make it about 'Desserts'. 
        These include Whited Brownies (which will set you on the path to chocolatey diabetes), 
        Chocolate coconut bars, and Hershey Bar Pie. Now I know they're all chocolate-based 
        desserts, but that's what we got in the family, a bunch of chocoholics. Some of these 
        are incredibly easy to make and I've actually used one in a school project where we 
        have to give a demonstration speech in front of the class.
